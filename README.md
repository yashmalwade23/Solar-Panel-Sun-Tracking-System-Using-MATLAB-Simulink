# Solar-Panel-Sun-Tracking-System-Using-MATLAB-Simulink

Objective: "The objective of the project was to design and simulate a solar panel tracking system by using MATLAB Simulink that keeps the panel aligned with the Sun throughout the day with the help of a PID Controller, maximizing energy output."

* Developed and simulated a dynamic solar panel sun-tracking system using MATLAB Simulink to optimize energy output.
* Modeled solar panel and motor using differential equations, by incorporating blocks such as Integrator, and Gain Block.
* Designed and fine-tuned a PID controller by utilizing Controller Block to minimize tracking errors and optimize the system's response to sun movement.
* Utilized Simulinkâ€™s scope block to visualize the angular position and velocity of the panel.
